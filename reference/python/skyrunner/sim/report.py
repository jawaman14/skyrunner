    ("Pine Ridge was a trap",
     "Feasibility sweep: a C172 could land at PNR but only take off again with <25% fuel. The 22 m tree lines "
     "60 m past each runway end blocked any loaded climb-out.",
     "Tree lines moved to 110 m past the ends and cut to 16 m (the 50 ft obstacle a pilot's handbook plans for). "
     "A C172 now gets out at every load the sweep tries."),
    ("Old Quarry was a trap",
     "No aircraft could take off from QRY in either direction: a 13 m rim just past the downhill end, and the "
     "pit wall (215 m in 240 m) past the other.",
     "Added a graded haul road out of the downhill end (`Airfield.haul_road`). QRY becomes a one-way strip: land "
     "uphill, take off downhill. It stays the hardest strip on the island."),
    ("Narrow strips had no way to turn round",
     "A 180-degree pivot needs about 13 m, more than the width of QRY (12 m) or PNR (15 m). Backtracking for a "
     "downhill takeoff left you in the rough.",
     "New actions: differential toe-brakes for pivot turns (`Controls.diff_brake`), and 'push her round' "
     "(key I, 20 s solo or 10 s with crew), which is what bush pilots actually do."),
    ("Flying under the radar never worked",
     "Tactical sweep: low-level runs with the transponder off were flagged 100% and busted 78-100%. Squawking "
     "like legitimate traffic delivered 89% against light police. That is the opposite of the history, and it "
     "made one tactic dominant.",
     "A primary-only radar track now builds suspicion slowly (1.2-4.2 %/s instead of 8-33 %/s), so it takes "
     "30-60 s of sustained track. Behaviour multiplies it: low and fast inbound from the sea x2.5, orbiting low "
     "over water +3 %/s, a squawk that vanishes mid-track +50. The aerostat's 20 m floor is the counter to "
     "low flying."),
    ("Then hiding in plain sight became dominant",
     "With the radar fix in, squawking like legitimate traffic delivered 73-100% of loads and was never "
     "flagged by light or standard police. Only an informant's tip stopped it. The quarry sits in radar "
     "shadow, so nothing saw where the 'legitimate' flight went.",
     "Two linked rules. (1) A squawking track that drops off the scope low and heading for a shady strip is "
     "flagged at once ('nobody legit lands at Old Quarry'); a bush strip only earns +30 suspicion, because "
     "honest jobs go there too. (2) A hot load at a bush or shady strip takes 60 s to unload, and a police "
     "aircraft within 2 km in that time means a raid. The tell now has consequences: the task force races "
     "you to the strip, and a patrol parked nearby wins the race."),
    ("Coast Guard cutters never caught anything",
     "0% boat seizures across 189 flights: cutters sailed from Port Harbor, 20 km away at 32 kt, and the "
     "go-fast was gone in 5 minutes.",
     "A funded cutter starts the night on picket off the coast (`Maritime.new_cutter(at=...)`). Seizures "
     "appear (13-17% of sea runs in later sweeps) without making airdrops pointless."),
    ("The law won 81% of seasons",
     "First strategic run: the runner equilibrium win rate was 0.18. Retiring rich happened in 2% of "
     "seasons, bribery cut win rate by 18 points, and wiretaps added 43 points.",
     "Retire target $90k -> $60k; run payout $11k -> $13k; contract crews cheaper ($4k -> $3k) and better "
     "paid (50% -> 60% share); bribes cheaper; wiretap 7 -> 4 evidence/night (warrant at 20 evidence, $7k); "
     "audits worth more (3.5 -> 6 per exposure point, $5k -> $4k); seizure share 50% -> 80% (the 1984 "
     "equitable-sharing rule); encryption $8k -> $5k; new runner order 'gear' (scanner/detector) so "
     "encryption has something to counter; comeback gap 30% -> 25%. Equilibrium: 0.18 -> 0.30 -> 0.49 -> 0.50."),
    ("Calibrated to flown numbers, the law won 98%",
     "Once the season simulator used rates flown by the bot instead of hand estimates, the organisation's "
     "equilibrium win rate fell to 2% and 48% of seasons ended broke. Three causes: the aerostat's 40 km "
     "radius covered every route on the island; the abstract model treated five police units as five times "
     "one; and every bust fed the case against the boss, a snowball.",
     "Aerostat radius 40 -> 22 km (south coast and sea lanes; the northern mountains are the way round it). "
     "Interception now has diminishing returns (`k * ln(1 + units)`, with k fitted to flown flights). Units "
     "cost more (helicopter $3k -> $4k, interceptor $5k -> $7k, aerostat $4k -> $6k). A contract crew's bust "
     "gives 2 evidence and never flips, because they don't know who they fly for. Bust evidence 12 -> 6; "
     "wiretap 4 -> 3; bankruptcy at -$10k. A bribed dispatcher's warning now reroutes the run away from the "
     "patrol and the balloon. Economy: run value $15k, retire at $45k, start with $16k, police base budget "
     "$9k. A 16-point grid search picked the last four. The bot's low-level crash rate is capped at 6% in "
     "the calibration, because it overstates a competent human. A smarter organisation bot joined the pool so "
     "both sides have one strategy that uses all its information (principle P8: balance at equal skill). "
     "Equilibrium: 0.02 -> 0.09 -> 0.25 -> 0.37 -> 0.475."),
    ("The test rig itself was wrong once",
     "'aerostat' and 'standard' postures gave identical numbers because the Session raises the aerostat "
     "automatically whenever the feature is on.",
     "Fixed in the rig (the aerostat is available but only raised by the posture). Lesson: check that "
     "configurations which should differ actually do, before believing the numbers."),
    ("Recruiting an informant was the single best move in the game",
     "At 8000 seasons the equilibrium (organisation win 45.5%) looked fair, but the ablation table told a "
     "different story: removing 'recruit' alone swung it to 60% (+14.5, the biggest number on the board). "
     "Reading the code found why: an informant gave three stacked, always-on bonuses (a flat +45% detection "
     "chance on tip nights, a 1.2x intercept-hazard multiplier on top of that, and 2.5 evidence/night per "
     "head, up to 3 heads) for $3k plus $1k/night upkeep, and a whole computed 'informant_mult' field was "
     "dead code that never reached the resolver. Worse, 'cautious' - the equilibrium runner strategy - never "
     "called 'counterintel' at all, so the one built-in counter to informants was never used by the side that "
     "was actually winning.",
     "Informant cap 3 -> 2; recruiting cost $3k -> $5k; evidence/informant 2.5 -> 1.8; the tip's detection "
     "bonus +45% -> +30% and its intercept-match multiplier 1.2x -> 1.1x; counterintel cheaper ($5k -> $4k) "
     "and burns 75% of informants instead of 60%. Removed the dead 'informant_mult' field instead of wiring "
     "it in on top of the tip bonus, which would have doubled up the same effect. Gave 'runner_cautious' a "
     "counterintel response whenever it already reaches for opsec (serious evidence rumour or heat > 70), "
     "matching what 'adaptive' and 'smart' already did. Equilibrium: 0.455 -> 0.450 at 40000 seasons; the "
     "investigation trio (recruit/audit/wiretap) still swings the most on ablation (+15 to +20 points each), "
     "which tracks with evidence being the task force's only win condition, but it is now measured, not "
     "accidentally doubled by dead code."),
    ("Recruiting a second informant was still nearly free",
     "Known limits flagged the fix above as partial: recruit's ablation stayed the single biggest number "
     "(+20.2) because the cost and odds only depended on the informant cap, not on how many were already "
     "in place. Stacking to the cap (2) cost the same $5k twice and succeeded at the same rate twice, so a "
     "chief who could afford it just always went to 2 early and never felt a choice.",
     "Recruiting cost now scales with the count already turned ($5k, then $10k for the second), and the "
     "success chance is multiplied by 0.6 per existing informant, so the second head is a real, worse bet "
     "rather than a free top-up. Equilibrium barely moved (0.450 -> 0.451 at 40000 seasons) because most of "
     "recruit's value is 'have one at all' versus 'have none', which this doesn't touch - that first "
     "informant is doing the work the task force's whole case-building game is built on. The remaining "
     "ablation size is now read as by-design (evidence is the task force's only win path) rather than a bug, "
     "per the note above."),
