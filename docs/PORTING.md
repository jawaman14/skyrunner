# Porting Skyrunner from Python/Panda3D to Godot 4

The Python game (the git tag `python-prototype-archive`; it is no longer in the tree) was ported module by module to Godot 4.4 (now running on 4.7, GDScript only; it
used a small C++ GDExtension until the flight model and the exact-maths helpers were rewritten in GDScript,
see "Leaving JSBSim" below). Every simulation module was checked against the Python original by running both on
the same seeds and comparing the output. This file explains how that was done, what matched exactly,
what didn't and why, and the traps along the way.

## What went where

| Python | Godot | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `jsbsim` (pip wheel) | `scripts/sim/flight/` `FlightDynamics` | The game's own 6-DOF model reading the same JSBSim-format aircraft files (JSBSim 1.3.1 through a GDExtension until the switch) |
| `random.Random` | `scripts/util/py_random.gd` `PyRandom` | Bit-exact CPython MT19937: `seed` (int and float via `_Py_HashDouble`), `random`, `uniform`, `randint`, `getrandbits`, `gauss`, `shuffle`, `choice`, `choices` |
| `numpy.random.default_rng` | `scripts/util/np_random.gd` `NpRandom` | SeedSequence + PCG64 `random`/`uniform` (terrain), 128-bit state in 16-bit limbs |
| `world.py` terrain (numpy) | `scripts/util/terrain.gd` `Terrain` | Island generator, heights, trees, line of sight; float32 steps rounded through a one-element `PackedFloat32Array`; generated grids cached in `user://terrain/` |
| `math.hypot`, `round`, `f"{x:.2f}"` | `scripts/util/py_math.gd` `PyMath` (+ `BigNat`) | CPython's own `vector_norm` (Veltkamp products instead of fma), correctly rounded round-half-even, formatting, `repr` and parsing via exact big-number decimals |
| `world, aircraft, loadout, fdm, autopilot, controls, jobs, events, roles, comms` | `scripts/sim/*.gd` | |
| `sensors, police, maritime, ai_smuggler, game (Session)` | `scripts/sim/*.gd` | `Session(**kw)` becomes `Session.new(opts_dict)` |
| `hq, nights, layers, campaign` | `scripts/sim/*.gd` | |
| `bots/pilot, route, autorun, hq` | `scripts/bots/*.gd` | numpy `arange`/`maximum`/`where` became explicit loops in the same order |
| `sim/feasibility, tactical, strategic, report, __main__` | `scripts/balance/*.gd` | `ProcessPoolExecutor` became headless Godot worker processes (`worker_pool.gd`) |
| `net/server, client, snapshot` | `scripts/net/*.gd` | Same line-JSON protocol: a Python station can join a Godot host and vice versa |
| `render/*`, `station.py`, `__main__.py` | `scripts/render`, `scripts/ui`, `scripts/station`, `scripts/game`, `scripts/main.gd` | Rebuilt for Godot, with the graphics overhaul and new menus |
| `tests/*.py` (pytest) | `tests/test_*.gd` | A small runner (`tests/run_tests.gd`, `tools/test.sh`) |

## How parity was checked

For each module, a generator under `tools/reference/` runs the Python game and writes a JSON fixture:

| Fixture | Generator | Checked by | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core_ref.json` | `gen_core.py` | `test_core_parity.gd` | Mass data, auto-balance and seeded job boards exact (the take-off roll now checks against `flight_golden.json`) |
| `session_ref.json` | `gen_session.py` | `test_session_parity.gd` | 300 s police-mode world exact at every minute; all 40 HQ bot pairings exact |
| `bots_ref.json` | `gen_bots.py` | `test_bots_parity.gd` | Route plans, approaches and departures for every strip exact (the seeded bot flight now checks against `flight_golden.json`) |
| `strategic_ref.json` | `gen_strategic.py` | `test_strategic.gd` | Seasons, win matrix, equilibrium, dominance, summary and action values exact. At n=200 the calibrated equilibrium is 0.497361506980898 in both |
| `trials_ref.json` | `gen_trials.py` | `test_trials_parity.gd` | The trial inputs; the flown results now check against `flight_golden.json` |
| `flight_golden.json` | `tools/regen_flight_golden.gd` (Godot) | `test_core_parity.gd`, `test_bots_parity.gd`, `test_trials_parity.gd` | Everything that flies, as the game's own flight model flies it: a determinism check, bit for bit |

Re-generate a fixture with `python3 tools/reference/gen_<name>.py` from a checkout of the tag
`python-prototype-archive` (the Python game lives under `reference/python` there), with its virtualenv active.

## Lessons (the traps)

1. **Godot's `Vector2`/`Vector3` are float32.** Simulation state uses plain `float` (float64) and Arrays.
   Vectors appear only in rendering.
2. **numpy 2 float32 promotion.** `world.height()` interpolates a float32 grid, and numpy 2 keeps the
   result in float32 where numpy 1 promoted it. `Terrain` reproduces the float32 path exactly
   (`height`), with `height64` alongside.
3. **`math.hypot` isn't `libm` `hypot`.** CPython uses its own `vector_norm` (scaled, with a correction
   step). It differs from glibc in about 0.6% of inputs, enough to change a branch eventually. Ported as
   `PyMath.hypot`/`hypot3`.
4. **GDScript float literals can be 1 ulp off.** Tests compare with a relative tolerance where a literal
   is involved. Constants that matter are computed, not typed.
5. **FMA contraction.** CPython's `vector_norm` uses fma for exact products. GDScript has none, so
   `PyMath` splits each factor (Veltkamp) and sums the four partial products: the same result, exactly.
   (The old GDExtension was built with `-ffp-contract=off` for the opposite reason.)
6. **Run `--import` before headless runs.** Without it a `--script` run can stall on an unresolved
   `class_name` instead of failing. `tools/test.sh` imports first.
7. **Runtime script errors don't abort.** GDScript logs a `SCRIPT ERROR` and carries on with `null`, so
   a broken test can "pass". `tools/test.sh` fails the run on any `SCRIPT ERROR` in the output.
8. **`JSON.stringify` loses precision, even with `full_precision`.** On Godot 4.4 it writes 15
   significant digits, and `String.num(v, 17)` and `String.to_float()` aren't correctly rounded either
   (about 40% of doubles don't survive a round trip). The fixes:
   - `PyMath.repr`/`parse` (shortest round-trip digits and correctly rounded parsing, exact through `BigNat`)
   - `Py.json()` for saved results
   - binary `var_to_bytes` for worker IPC
9. **Methods aren't properties.** `wb.ok` on a method returns a `Callable`, which is always truthy.
   GDScript won't warn. It hid a bug where the AutoRunner never hired a loadmaster.
10. **`bool()` only takes numbers, and truthiness differs.** `Py.truthy()` gives Python semantics for
    `None`, empty containers and strings.
11. **Monkeypatching has no equivalent.** Python tests replaced `police.tick` and the ablations replaced
    `season._r_bribe`. The port has explicit switches instead: `PoliceSystem.frozen` and
    `HQ.Season.disabled`.
12. **Stable sorts and first-wins min/max.** `sort_custom` isn't stable, and Python's `min(key=)` keeps
    the first minimum. `Py.sorted_by`, `Py.min_by` and `Py.max_by` reproduce both.
13. **Tests must start after the SceneTree is the main loop.** Nodes added during `_init` or
    `_initialize` aren't inside the tree. The runner starts on the first `_process` frame.
14. **JSBSim turbulence and respawning didn't mix.** With Dryden turbulence on (`atmosphere/turb-type` 4),
    re-running the initial conditions segfaulted inside JSBSim. The game's own flight model has no such
    trap, but `Session._apply_wind()` still sets the weather after every spawn.
15. **The sky shader's LIGHT0 is the first visible DirectionalLight3D.** Hiding the sun at night makes the
    moon LIGHT0, and the sky shader then draws a daytime sky. The sun stays visible at zero energy.
16. **CharacterBody3D doesn't step up kerbs.** `Walker._step_up()` probes with `test_move`: up, then
    forward, then drops back down. A hit only counts as a ceiling when its normal points down
    (`y < -0.5`). Otherwise the edge of the step itself reads as a ceiling.
17. **New rules need a switch and their own random stream.** Everything added after the port (weather,
    pattern of life, canary, rival tempers) is a `HQ.RULES` flag. `PYTHON_RULES` switches them all off,
    and their draws come from `Season.xrng`, so the Python fixtures still match bit for bit.

## Where exact parity stops

- **JSBSim builds differed by ulps** (history: the flight model is the game's own now). The pip wheel and the CMake build disagreed in the last bits of
  `position/long-gc-deg` now and then (compiler and libm). Most flights never notice. A flight that
  passes close to a bot decision threshold amplifies it. The tipped north run is identical to 1e-12
  until t=88 s, then 0.7 mm apart at t=119 s, and ends in the same bust a minute later. Over the
  189-flight tactical sweep, 130 flights are identical. The rest diverge symmetrically: 109 vs 109
  flagged, 69 vs 69 delivered.
- **The calibration inherits that noise.** Each calibration cell has only 9 flights. The divergence
  above moved the fitted `intercept_k` from 2.0 to 1.3, and the season equilibrium from 45% to 69%.
  This is a real weakness of the original balance method, not of the port. The Godot balance run uses
  10 seeds per cell (630 flights).
- **The rival cartel is Godot-only.** With `rules.rivals` on, seasons can't be compared with Python.
  The parity tests run with `{"rivals": false}`. The cartel draws from its own random stream, so
  switching it off reproduces Python exactly.

## Deliberate changes from the plan

- **Networking uses TCP with the Python line-JSON protocol, not ENet.** Wire compatibility with the
  Python clients was worth more than ENet's features for 20 Hz snapshots. `test_net.gd` checks the raw
  wire format, and a Python `NetClient` was run against the Godot dedicated server.
- **Balance workers are processes, not threads.** Every core stays busy, and the static rule switches
  stay per process (JSBSim's process-wide state was the first reason).

## Leaving JSBSim (Godot only)

The game ran JSBSim 1.3.1 and the exact-maths helpers through a C++ GDExtension. That tied every
build to a compiler per platform (no macOS build could be made from Linux, Windows needed MinGW),
so the extension was replaced by GDScript:

- **The helpers** (`PyRandom`, `NpRandom`, `PyMath`, `Terrain`) were ported line for line and checked
  against the C++ classes before the switch: 0 mismatches over ~76k RNG draws and 20 seeds, all
  263,169 heights and 8,222 trees of the island, every terrain query; `PyMath` exact on every function
  but `log1p` (fdlibm's, which differs from glibc's in the last bit of 0.03% of inputs; it feeds the
  interception hazard, and `test_strategic.gd` checks the seasons still match the Python fixtures). The Python
  fixtures for everything that doesn't fly pass unchanged.
- **The flight model** (`FlightDynamics`) can't be bit-identical to JSBSim, so the flown fixtures were
  re-baselined as Godot golden values (`tools/regen_flight_golden.gd` -> `tests/fixtures/flight_golden.json`),
  and the balance calibration was re-flown with it (BALANCE.md). The aircraft files are the same data;
  the C172's propeller gained `ct_factor`/`cp_factor` to reach its handbook static rpm, ground roll and
  climb with a 160 hp engine.
- **Traps:** a GDScript `var x := <Variant>` fails to parse under warnings-as-errors, and a script that
  doesn't parse never reaches `quit()`, which looks like a hang; a literal `-0.0` folds to +0 (build
  negative zero at run time); packed arrays are values, so appending to one fetched from a Dictionary
  changes a copy; `PackedFloat32Array(PackedFloat64Array)` doesn't exist.
